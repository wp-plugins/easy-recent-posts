An easy to use WordPress function to add recent posts to any theme.

== Description ==

This easy to use WordPress plugin is designed to add a new feature for theme developers. Used on many of my own websites as well as those of my clients, the plugin allows me to quickly add a collection of recent posts to any theme element.

The plugin can easily be used by website owners as a WordPress Widget, adding lists of posts to the Sidebar of a WordPress website.

= About the plugin =

More advanced users can also call the functionality of the plugin from a WordPress shortcode by adding the code `[thisismyurl_easy_recent_posts]` to any Post or Page within WordPress.

Finally, theme authors may also take advantage of the plugin by calling the functionality directly from theme files with the code `thisismyurl_easy_recent_posts();`.
